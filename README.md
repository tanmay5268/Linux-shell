# Linux Shell

A simple Linux shell implemented in C by **Tanmay**. This project is designed to mimic a basic shell environment, allowing users to execute commands, handle input/output redirection, and implement other fundamental shell functionalities.

## Features

- Execute built-in Linux commands
- Handle input and output redirection
- Support for background processes using `&`
- Command history and basic parsing
- Extensible and modular structure

## Why Learn a Shell Environment?

Understanding and working with a shell environment is a critical skill for developers and system administrators. It helps in automating tasks, managing systems efficiently, and gaining deeper insights into how operating systems function. This project serves as a hands-on approach to learning the core concepts behind shell environments and systems programming in C.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Linux-based operating system
- GCC compiler (to compile the C code)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tanmay5268/Linux-shell.git
   cd Linux-shell
   ```

2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   gcc shell.c -o shell
   ```

3. Run the shell:
   ```bash
   ./shell
   ```

## Usage

Once the shell is running, you can:

- Execute Linux commands:
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```

- Run background processes:
  ```bash
  ping google.com &
  ```

- Use input/output redirection:
  ```bash
  cat < input.txt > output.txt
  ```
